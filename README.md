Caching is a powerful technique for improving performance in applications. Let's consider an example where we manage department caching:

Initially, we retrieve all departments from the database and store them in the cache. This allows subsequent requests for all departments to be served directly from the cache, resulting in improved performance.

However, what if someone updates a department? In this case, we need to clear the cache to ensure that the updated information is reflected in subsequent requests. By clearing the cache, we eliminate any potential discrepancies between the cached data and the database.

If we don't clear the cache after updating a department, subsequent requests for all departments will still return the outdated information from the cache. However, if we update the cache in the update method, it ensures that when we request all departments again, they will be retrieved from the database and then stored in the cache. This process effectively eliminates any gaps between the database and the cache, ensuring data consistency.

By properly managing the cache, we strike a balance between performance and data accuracy. Caching allows us to serve data quickly from memory, reducing the need for expensive database queries. However, we must also consider cache invalidation strategies to ensure that the cached data remains up to date. In the case of department updates, clearing the cache or updating it after each modification ensures that subsequent requests retrieve the most recent data from the database.
